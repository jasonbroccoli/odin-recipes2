    <h2>Creamy Southern Grits</h2>
    <p>
        This classic grits recipe yields a rich and creamy side dish with a smooth, comforting texture. Made with stone-ground grits cooked in water 
        (or a mix of water and milk), it achieves a perfect balance of flavor and creaminess. The grits are seasoned with salt and enhanced with butter, 
        and optionally cheese, to create a luscious, savory base that pairs well with a variety of dishes. It's a versatile and satisfying accompaniment, 
        ideal for breakfast or as a side for lunch or dinner.
