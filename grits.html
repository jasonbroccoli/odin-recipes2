    <h2>Creamy Southern Grits</h2>
    <p>
        This classic grits recipe yields a rich and creamy side dish with a smooth, comforting texture. Made with stone-ground grits cooked in water 
        (or a mix of water and milk), it achieves a perfect balance of flavor and creaminess. The grits are seasoned with salt and enhanced with butter, 
        and optionally cheese, to create a luscious, savory base that pairs well with a variety of dishes. It's a versatile and satisfying accompaniment, 
        ideal for breakfast or as a side for lunch or dinner.

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup stone-ground grits (not instant)</li>
            <li>4 cups water (or you can use a combination of water and milk for creamier grits)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated cheese (optional, cheddar is a popular choice)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil Water: In a medium saucepan, bring 4 cups of water (or 2 cups water and 2 cups milk for extra creaminess) to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
            
            <li>Add Grits: Gradually whisk in 1 cup of grits to prevent lumps. Reduce the heat to low.</li>
            
            <li>Simmer: Cover the pot and let the grits simmer gently, stirring occasionally. Stone-ground grits can take 30-40 minutes to cook, so be patient. 
                Stir frequently to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking. If the grits become too thick, you can add a bit more water or milk to reach your 
                desired consistency.</li>
            
            <li>Add Butter and Cheese: Once the grits are creamy and tender, stir in 2 tablespoons of butter. If you're using cheese, add it now and stir until 
                melted and fully incorporated.</li>
            
            <li>Season to Taste: Taste the grits and adjust the seasoning if needed. You can add more salt, pepper, or even a dash of hot sauce if you like a 
                bit of spice.</li>
            
            <li>Serve: Serve the grits hot as a side dish or a base for other ingredients like shrimp, sausage, or vegetables.</li>
        </ol>
